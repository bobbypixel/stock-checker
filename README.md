# stock-checker
A simple command line tool that allows the user to enter a stock symbol and then displays the latest price for that stock.

This project idea was from BeginnerPy: [:chart_with_upwards_trend: Stock Checker](https://github.com/beginnerpy-com/project-ideas/blob/main/projects/stock-checker.md)
